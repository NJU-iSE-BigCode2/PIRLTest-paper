# PIRLTest Project
This project contains 2 sides - framework and device sides.

The framework side implements the core method of PIRLTest, while the device side implements the interaction with devices and the whole process of PIRLTest.

## The Framework Side
The framework side implements an HTTP server for the device side.

A Linux server with GPU and CUDA support is necessary for deployment.

### Deployment
1. Install the requirements.
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Config OCR. Modify the `ocr()` method in `img_process/ocr_canny.py` (use your own id and keys).
3. Run the app.
```sh
./run.sh
```

It is deployed on http://localhost:5000.


## The Device Side
The device side is an application. It can run on a server connected to Android devices for Android testing, or on a computer with Chrome installed for Web testing.

We use SSH as the protocol to connect server where the framework side deploys. So make sure that SSH service is running on your server.

### Preparation
1. Install the requirements.
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Config SSH: modify `configs/ssh_config.json`. Specify ip, port, username and password.
3. Test config: create a test config file under `configs` folder. 
3. Take `configs/android/wikipedia.json` and `configs/web/webogram.json`as examples. 
	- `platform`: `android` or `web`
	- `serial_no`: the serial number of the **Android** device
	- `screen_size`: the screen size of the device
	- `pre_interact`: whether to manually log in the app before testing
	- `server_proj_dir`: the path of where the framework side deploys
	- `server_screenshot_dir`: `screenshots` only
	- `local_screenshot_path`: where the screenshot saves locally
	- `window_keys`: not used
	- `total_time`: testing time in seconds
	- `banner_height`: The height of the top status bar of **Android** device.
	- `remote_port`: the port of the framework side
	- `app.name`: the name of the app under test
	- `app.pkg`: the package of the **Android** app
	- `app.main_activity`: the main activity of the **Android** app
	- `app.url`: the url of the **Web** app
4. Update chromedriver.exe if testing web application.

### Run
For Android app testing, use the following command:
```sh
python pirltest_android.py <config_path>
```

For Web app testing, use the following command:
```sh
python launcher.py <config_path>
```

### After Testing
For Android apps, if instrumented properly, the .exec coverage data files would be pulled to `coverages` folder. For Web apps, if instrumented properly, the .json coverage data file would be downloaded under `$HOME/Download` folder.

The log of the device side would be under `logs` folder.

All the screenshots and the framework side logs would be on the server.
